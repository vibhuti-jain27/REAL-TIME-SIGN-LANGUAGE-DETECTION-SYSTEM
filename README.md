# REAL-TIME-SIGN-LANGUAGE-DETECTION-SYSTEM
Real-time sign language detection system is an innovative technology that utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to interpret and translate sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time. By capturing and analyzing video input of hand gestures and movements, the system can recognize various signs and gestures commonly used in sign language communication. Through advanced pattern recognition and deep learning techniques, the system can accurately interpret these gestures and translate them into understandable text or spoken language, enabling seamless communication between sign language users and individuals who may not understand sign language. This technology has the potential to significantly enhance accessibility and communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community, bridging the gap between sign language and spoken language users in various real-world scenarios.
